- make html and feed as valid as possible (atm: still need to encode ampersands which for some reason doesn't happen in the 'e' smarty modifier, which calls htmlentities)

URL generator class
- knows current document URL when referencing external files (e.g. hardcoded '../' in header_subpage.tpl)
- can generate both full URL and relative path
- when providing state in URL parameters: don't include parameters that are set to default values anyway (e.g. &c=..., &n=...)

support for relative path/file names in .htaccess files
- /a/.htaccess requires absolute filename of htpasswd file, but we would prefer to provide a relative path
- at minimum: try to only have one location in one file where we specify full deployment path
  - e.g. generate all htaccess files when deploying -> not nice
  - better: auto-detect at runtime (may not be possible within .htaccess files)
