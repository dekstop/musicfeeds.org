- use numerical character entities in encoded feed markup as opposed to HTML entities
  - http://feedvalidator.org/docs/error/UndefinedNamedEntity.html 
  -> controller should be able to change View.php's escaping rules
- get rid of all x->raw() calls in templates
- TODO: unit tests for custom View.php renderers
- TODO: HTML::sanitise/excerpt in combination with View.php means we double(/triple?)-escape HTML entities
  - TODO: when the above is fixed: re-evaluate if we need CDATA tags around feed title/content
- TODO: implement a replacement for Apache ErrorDocument that allows us to display templates (e.g. on 404), but still works on template errors (e.g. 503)

- make html and feed as valid as possible (quite hard when displaying arbitrary external markup...)

URL generator class/routing
- get relative request by stripping path elements in $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] from $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']
- knows current document URL when referencing external files (e.g. get rid of hardcoded '../' in header_subpage.tpl)
- can generate both full URL and relative path
- when providing state in URL parameters: don't include parameters that are set to default values anyway (e.g. &c=..., &n=...)

support for relative path/file names in .htaccess files
- /a/.htaccess requires absolute filename of htpasswd file, but we would prefer to provide a relative path
- at minimum: try to only have one location in one file where we specify full deployment path
  - e.g. generate all htaccess files when deploying -> not nice
  - better: auto-detect at runtime (may not be possible within .htaccess files)

Extract components:
- "MC" model+controller framework; maybe even just the controller part.
- database abstraction (?)
-
