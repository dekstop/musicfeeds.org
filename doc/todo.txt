URL generator class
- know current path when referencing external files (e.g. hardcoded '../' in header_subpage.tpl)
- can generate both full URL and relative path
- 

support for relative path/file names in .htaccess files
- /.htaccess routes require knowledge of current app path in URL
- /a/.htaccess requires absolute filename of htpasswd file
- we always would prefer to provide relative paths
- at minimum: try to only have one location in one file where we specify full deployment path
  - e.g. generate all htaccess files when deploying -> not nice
  - better: auto-detect at runtime (may not be possible within .htaccess files)
