 = Installation =
 ================

Setup
- rename ./app/conf/app_env.php.example to app_env.php, edit settings (DB, Solr, etc)
- rename ./app/conf/smarty.conf.example to smarty.conf, edit settings (display strings)
- ensure that ./var/templates_c and ./var/cache are writable for your Apache process (under Debian: chmod -R www-data:www-data ./var/*)

Apache configuration
- make sure Apache follows symlinks (Options FollowSymLinks) so we can use mod_rewrite
- to host as a dedicated site: set Apache DocumentRoot to /<app root>/app/htdocs/
- To host as a subdirectory of an existing site: symlink from somewhere in your Apache DocumentRoot to /<app root>/app/htdocs/

To set up HTTP Basic auth for admin area:
- add some users to ./app/conf/htpasswd (default account is editor/editor)
- provide the _absolute_ path to the htpasswd file in ./app/htdocs/a/.htaccess (as AuthUserFile)
